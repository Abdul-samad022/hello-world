# hello-world
My first repository
I'm Abdul-samad, I love coding and I'm always eager to learn. 
My journey in coding hasn't reach anywhere yet; I can barely write a few HTML and Python codes.
I joined this community to advance my knowledge in coding.
I'm interested in AI, ML, data analysis, and web development.
Though i enjoy it as a fun, I would like to have a career in any of the above areas
